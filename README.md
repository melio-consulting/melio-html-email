# HTML Email Templates

How to use these templates directly in Apple Mail ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48214386/insert-html-into-email-in-apple-mail)):

1. Create a new mail in apple "Mail.app", write anything then hit  `cmd+s` 
2. Find your draft at the left panel of "Mail.app". Drag it onto your desktop.
3. Edit the draft file with any text editor you like. See some html source code at the bottom of the draft file? Replace them with the html code you want to send then save the file.
4. Open "File" - "Import Mailboxes" in "mail.app". Select "Apple Mail", import the edited draft file.
5. You will see your mail at the left panel of "Mail.app". Drag it into a "Draft" mailbox.
6. Finally open the mail, fill in To, CC, Subject, etc, and send your pure HTML mail.
